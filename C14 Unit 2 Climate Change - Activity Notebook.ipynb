    "Pollution, mostly associated as a by-product of urban landscapes, is also linked with climate change. Both climate change and air pollution are exacerbated by the burning of fossil fuels, which increase CO2 emissions, the cause of global warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In October 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a report that 93 per cent of the world’s children breathe toxic air every day. According to the report, 1.8 billion children breathe air that is so polluted it puts their health and development at serious risk. WHO estimates that in 2016, 600,000 children died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air. The report highlights that “More than 40% of the world’s population – which includes 1 billion children under 15 - is exposed to high levels of household air pollution from mainly cooking with polluting technologies and fuels.” In developing countries, women frequently rely on coal and biomass fuels for cooking and heating, putting them and their and their children at higher risk to the effects of home pollutants.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHO recommends and supports the implementation of policies to reduce air pollution, including better waste management, the use of clean technologies and fuels for household cooking, heating and lighting to improve the quality of air in homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effects of climate change are worse among poor and low-income communities, in part because many live on the margins of society, in unstable structures, and in areas more susceptible to flooding, landslides, earthquakes, but also because of inadequate capacities, inadequate resources and reduced access to emergency response systems. This is even more pronounced in developing countries.\n",
